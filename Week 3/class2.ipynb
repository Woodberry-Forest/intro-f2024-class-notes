      "INTRODUCTION.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Scepticism is as much the result of knowledge, as knowledge is of\n",
      "scepticism. To be content with what we at present know, is, for the\n",
      "most part, to shut our ears against conviction; since, from the very\n",
      "gradual character of our education, we must continually forget, and\n",
      "emancipate ourselves from, knowledge previously acquired; we must set\n",
      "aside old notions and embrace fresh ones; and, as we learn, we must be\n",
      "daily unlearning something which it has cost us no small labour and\n",
      "anxiety to acquire.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this difficulty attaches itself more closely to an age in which\n",
      "progress has gained a strong ascendency over prejudice, and in which\n",
      "persons and things are, day by day, finding their real level, in lieu\n",
      "of their conventional value. The same principles which have swept away\n",
      "traditional abuses, and which are making rapid havoc among the revenues\n",
      "of sinecurists, and stripping the thin, tawdry veil from attractive\n",
      "superstitions, are working as actively in literature as in society. The\n",
      "credulity of one writer, or the partiality of another, finds as\n",
      "powerful a touchstone and as wholesome a chastisement in the healthy\n",
      "scepticism of a temperate class of antagonists, as the dreams of\n",
      "conservatism, or the impostures of pluralist sinecures in the Church.\n",
      "History and tradition, whether of ancient or comparatively recent\n",
      "times, are subjected to very different handling from that which the\n",
      "indulgence or credulity of former ages could allow. Mere statements are\n",
      "jealously watched, and the motives of the writer form as important an\n",
      "ingredient in the analysis of his history, as the facts he records.\n",
      "Probability is a powerful and troublesome test; and it is by this\n",
      "troublesome standard that a large portion of historical evidence is\n",
      "sifted. Consistency is no less pertinacious and exacting in its\n",
      "demands. In brief, to write a history, we must know more than mere\n",
      "facts. Human nature, viewed under an introduction of extended\n",
      "experience, is the best help to the criticism of human history.\n",
      "Historical characters can only be estimated by the standard which human\n",
      "experience, whether actual or traditionary, has furnished. To form\n",
      "correct views of individuals we must regard them as forming parts of a\n",
      "great whole—we must measure them by their relation to the mass of\n",
      "beings by whom they are surrounded; and, in contemplating the incidents\n",
      "in their lives or condition which tradition has handed down to us, we\n",
      "must rather consider the general bearing of the whole narrative, than\n",
      "the respective probability of its details.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is unfortunate for us, that, of some of the greatest men, we know\n",
      "least, and talk most. Homer, Socrates, and Shakespere have, perhaps,\n",
      "contributed more to the intellectual enlightenment of mankind than any\n",
      "other three writers who could be named, and yet the history of all\n",
      "three has given rise to a boundless ocean of discussion, which has left\n",
      "us little save the option of choosing which theory or theories we will\n",
      "follow. The personality of Shakespere is, perhaps, the only thing in\n",
      "which critics will allow us to believe without controversy; but upon\n",
      "everything else, even down to the authorship of plays, there is more or\n",
      "less of doubt and uncertainty. Of Socrates we know as little as the\n",
      "contradictions of Plato and Xenophon will allow us to know. He was one\n",
      "of the _dramatis personæ_ in two dramas as unlike in principles as in\n",
      "style. He appears as the enunciator of opinions as different in their\n",
      "tone as those of the writers who have handed them down. When we have\n",
      "read Plato _or_ Xenophon, we think we know something of Socrates; when\n",
      "we have fairly read and examined both, we feel convinced that we are\n",
      "something worse than ignorant.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been an easy, and a popular expedient of late years, to deny the\n",
      "personal or real existence of men and things whose life and condition\n",
      "were too much for our belief. This system—which has often comforted the\n",
      "religious sceptic, and substituted the consolations of Strauss for\n",
      "those of the New Testament—has been of incalculable value to the\n",
      "historical theorists of the last and present centuries. To question the\n",
      "existence of Alexander the Great, would be a more excusable act, than\n",
      "to believe in that of Romulus. To deny a fact related in Herodotus,\n",
      "because it is inconsistent with a theory developed from an Assyrian\n",
      "inscription which no two scholars read in the same way, is more\n",
      "pardonable, than to believe in the good-natured old king whom the\n",
      "elegant pen of Florian has idealized—_Numa Pompilius_.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scepticism has attained its culminating point with respect to Homer,\n",
      "and the state of our Homeric knowledge may be described as a free\n",
      "permission to believe any theory, provided we throw overboard all\n",
      "written tradition, concerning the author or authors of the Iliad and\n",
      "Odyssey. What few authorities exist on the subject, are summarily\n",
      "dismissed, although the arguments appear to run in a circle. “This\n",
      "cannot be true, because it is not true; and that is not true, because\n",
      "it cannot be true.” Such seems to be the style, in which testimony upon\n",
      "testimony, statement upon statement, is consigned to denial and\n",
      "oblivion.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is, however, unfortunate that the professed biographies of Homer are\n",
      "partly forgeries, partly freaks of ingenuity and imagination, in which\n",
      "truth is the requisite most wanting. Before taking a brief review of\n",
      "the Homeric theory in its present conditions, some notice must be taken\n",
      "of the treatise on the Life of Homer which has been attributed to\n",
      "Herodotus.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to this document, the city of Cumae in AEolia was, at an\n",
      "early period, the seat of frequent immigrations from various parts of\n",
      "Greece. Among the immigrants was Menapolus, the son of Ithagenes.\n",
      "Although poor, he married, and the result of the union was a girl named\n",
      "Critheis. The girl was left an orphan at an early age, under the\n",
      "guardianship of Cleanax, of Argos. It is to the indiscretion of this\n",
      "maiden that we “are indebted for so much happiness.” Homer was the\n",
      "first fruit of her juvenile frailty, and received the name of\n",
      "Melesigenes from having been born near the river Meles in Bœotia,\n",
      "whither Critheis had been transported in order to save her reputation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At this time,” continues our narrative, “there lived at Smyrna a man\n",
      "named Phemius, a teacher of literature and music, who, not being\n",
      "married, engaged Critheis to manage his household, and spin the flax he\n",
      "received as the price of his scholastic labours. So satisfactory was\n",
      "her performance of this task, and so modest her conduct, that he made\n",
      "proposals of marriage, declaring himself, as a further inducement,\n",
      "willing to adopt her son, who, he asserted, would become a clever man,\n",
      "if he were carefully brought up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They were married; careful cultivation ripened the talents which nature\n",
      "had bestowed, and Melesigenes soon surpassed his schoolfellows in every\n",
      "attainment, and, when older, rivalled his preceptor in wisdom. Phemius\n",
      "died, leaving him sole heir to his property, and his mother soon\n",
      "followed. Melesigenes carried on his adopted father’s school with great\n",
      "success, exciting the admiration not only of the inhabitants of Smyrna,\n",
      "but also of the strangers whom the trade carried on there, especially\n",
      "in the exportation of corn, attracted to that city. Among these\n",
      "visitors, one Mentes, from Leucadia, the modern Santa Maura, who\n",
      "evinced a knowledge and intelligence rarely found in those times,\n",
      "persuaded Melesigenes to close his school, and accompany him on his\n",
      "travels. He promised not only to pay his expenses, but to furnish him\n",
      "with a further stipend, urging, that, “While he was yet young, it was\n",
      "fitting that he should see with his own eyes the countries and cities\n",
      "which might hereafter be the subjects of his discourses.” Melesigenes\n",
      "consented, and set out with his patron, “examining all the curiosities\n",
      "of the countries they visited, and informing himself of everything by\n",
      "interrogating those whom he met.” We may also suppose, that he wrote\n",
      "memoirs of all that he deemed worthy of preservation. Having set sail\n",
      "from Tyrrhenia and Iberia, they reached Ithaca. Here Melesigenes, who\n",
      "had already suffered in his eyes, became much worse; and Mentes, who\n",
      "was about to leave for Leucadia, left him to the medical\n",
      "superintendence of a friend of his, named Mentor, the son of Alcinor.\n",
      "Under his hospitable and intelligent host, Melesigenes rapidly became\n",
      "acquainted with the legends respecting Ulysses, which afterwards formed\n",
      "the subject of the Odyssey. The inhabitants of Ithaca assert, that it\n",
      "was here that Melesigenes became blind, but the Colophonians make their\n",
      "city the seat of that misfortune. He then returned to Smyrna, where he\n",
      "applied himself to the study of poetry.\n",
      "\n",
      "But poverty soon drove him to Cumae. Having passed over the Hermaean\n",
      "plain, he arrived at Neon Teichos, the New Wall, a colony of Cumae.\n",
      "Here his misfortunes and poetical talent gained him the friendship of\n",
      "one Tychias, an armourer. “And up to my time,” continues the author,\n",
      "“the inhabitants showed the place where he used to sit when giving a\n",
      "recitation of his verses; and they greatly honoured the spot. Here also\n",
      "a poplar grew, which they said had sprung up ever since Melesigenes\n",
      "arrived.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But poverty still drove him on, and he went by way of Larissa, as being\n",
      "the most convenient road. Here, the Cumans say, he composed an epitaph\n",
      "on Gordius, king of Phrygia, which has however, and with greater\n",
      "probability, been attributed to Cleobulus of Lindus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arrived at Cumae, he frequented the _conversaziones_ of the old men,\n",
      "and delighted all by the charms of his poetry. Encouraged by this\n",
      "favourable reception, he declared that, if they would allow him a\n",
      "public maintenance, he would render their city most gloriously\n",
      "renowned. They avowed their willingness to support him in the measure\n",
      "he proposed, and procured him an audience in the council. Having made\n",
      "the speech, with the purport of which our author has forgotten to\n",
      "acquaint us, he retired, and left them to debate respecting the answer\n",
      "to be given to his proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The greater part of the assembly seemed favourable to the poet’s\n",
      "demand, but one man “observed that if they were to feed _Homers_, they\n",
      "would be encumbered with a multitude of useless people.” “From this\n",
      "circumstance,” says the writer, “Melesigenes acquired the name of\n",
      "Homer, for the Cumans call blind men _Homers_.” With a love of economy,\n",
      "which shows how similar the world has always been in its treatment of\n",
      "literary men, the pension was denied, and the poet vented his\n",
      "disappointment in a wish that Cumae might never produce a poet capable\n",
      "of giving it renown and glory.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Phocaea Homer was destined to experience another literary distress.\n",
      "One Thestorides, who aimed at the reputation of poetical genius, kept\n",
      "Homer in his own house, and allowed him a pittance, on condition of the\n",
      "verses of the poet passing in his name. Having collected sufficient\n",
      "poetry to be profitable, Thestorides, like some would-be literary\n",
      "publishers, neglected the man whose brains he had sucked, and left him.\n",
      "At his departure, Homer is said to have observed: “O Thestorides, of\n",
      "the many things hidden from the knowledge of man, nothing is more\n",
      "unintelligible than the human heart.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Homer continued his career of difficulty and distress, until some Chian\n",
      "merchants, struck by the similarity of the verses they heard him\n",
      "recite, acquainted him with the fact that Thestorides was pursuing a\n",
      "profitable livelihood by the recital of the very same poems. This at\n",
      "once determined him to set out for Chios. No vessel happened then to be\n",
      "setting sail thither, but he found one ready to start for Erythrae, a\n",
      "town of Ionia, which faces that island, and he prevailed upon the\n",
      "seamen to allow him to accompany them. Having embarked, he invoked a\n",
      "favourable wind, and prayed that he might be able to expose the\n",
      "imposture of Thestorides, who, by his breach of hospitality, had drawn\n",
      "down the wrath of Jove the Hospitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Erythrae, Homer fortunately met with a person who had known him in\n",
      "Phocaea, by whose assistance he at length, after some difficulty,\n",
      "reached the little hamlet of Pithys. Here he met with an adventure,\n",
      "which we will continue in the words of our author. “Having set out from\n",
      "Pithys, Homer went on, attracted by the cries of some goats that were\n",
      "pasturing. The dogs barked on his approach, and he cried out. Glaucus\n",
      "(for that was the name of the goat-herd) heard his voice, ran up\n",
      "quickly, called off his dogs, and drove them away from Homer. For some\n",
      "time he stood wondering how a blind man should have reached such a\n",
      "place alone, and what could be his design in coming. He then went up to\n",
      "him and inquired who he was, and how he had come to desolate places and\n",
      "untrodden spots, and of what he stood in need. Homer, by recounting to\n",
      "him the whole history of his misfortunes, moved him with compassion;\n",
      "and he took him and led him to his cot, and, having lit a fire, bade\n",
      "him sup.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The dogs, instead of eating, kept barking at the stranger, according\n",
      "to their usual habit. Whereupon Homer addressed Glaucus thus: O\n",
      "Glaucus, my friend, prythee attend to my behest. First give the dogs\n",
      "their supper at the doors of the hut: for so it is better, since,\n",
      "whilst they watch, nor thief nor wild beast will approach the fold.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Glaucus was pleased with the advice and marvelled at its author.\n",
      "Having finished supper, they banqueted afresh on conversation, Homer\n",
      "narrating his wanderings, and telling of the cities he had visited.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At length they retired to rest; but on the following morning, Glaucus\n",
      "resolved to go to his master, and acquaint him with his meeting with\n",
      "Homer. Having left the goats in charge of a fellow-servant, he left\n",
      "Homer at home, promising to return quickly. Having arrived at Bolissus,\n",
      "a place near the farm, and finding his mate, he told him the whole\n",
      "story respecting Homer and his journey. He paid little attention to\n",
      "what he said, and blamed Glaucus for his stupidity in taking in and\n",
      "feeding maimed and enfeebled persons. However, he bade him bring the\n",
      "stranger to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Glaucus told Homer what had taken place, and bade him follow him,\n",
      "assuring him that good fortune would be the result. Conversation soon\n",
      "showed that the stranger was a man of much cleverness and general\n",
      "knowledge, and the Chian persuaded him to remain, and to undertake the\n",
      "charge of his children.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the satisfaction of driving the impostor Thestorides from the\n",
      "island, Homer enjoyed considerable success as a teacher. In the town of\n",
      "Chios he established a school, where he taught the precepts of poetry.\n",
      "“To this day,” says Chandler, “the most curious remain is that which\n",
      "has been named, without reason, the School of Homer. It is on the\n",
      "coast, at some distance from the city, northward, and appears to have\n",
      "been an open temple of Cybele, formed on the top of a rock. The shape\n",
      "is oval, and in the centre is the image of the goddess, the head and an\n",
      "arm wanting. She is represented, as usual, sitting. The chair has a\n",
      "lion carved on each side, and on the back. The area is bounded by a low\n",
      "rim, or seat, and about five yards over. The whole is hewn out of the\n",
      "mountain, is rude, indistinct, and probably of the most remote\n",
      "antiquity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So successful was this school, that Homer realised a considerable\n",
      "fortune. He married, and had two daughters, one of whom died single,\n",
      "the other married a Chian.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following passage betrays the same tendency to connect the\n",
      "personages of the poems with the history of the poet, which has already\n",
      "been mentioned:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“In his poetical compositions Homer displays great gratitude towards\n",
      "Mentor of Ithaca, in the Odyssey, whose name he has inserted in his\n",
      "poem as the companion of Ulysses, in return for the care taken of him\n",
      "when afflicted with blindness. He also testifies his gratitude to\n",
      "Phemius, who had given him both sustenance and instruction.”\n",
      "\n",
      "His celebrity continued to increase, and many persons advised him to\n",
      "visit Greece whither his reputation had now extended. Having, it is\n",
      "said, made some additions to his poems calculated to please the vanity\n",
      "of the Athenians, of whose city he had hitherto made no mention, he set\n",
      "out for Samos. Here, being recognized by a Samian, who had met with him\n",
      "in Chios, he was handsomely received, and invited to join in\n",
      "celebrating the Apaturian festival. He recited some verses, which gave\n",
      "great satisfaction, and by singing the Eiresione at the New Moon\n",
      "festivals, he earned a subsistence, visiting the houses of the rich,\n",
      "with whose children he was very popular.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the spring he sailed for Athens, and arrived at the island of Ios,\n",
      "now Ino, where he fell extremely ill, and died. It is said that his\n",
      "death arose from vexation, at not having been able to unravel an enigma\n",
      "proposed by some fishermen’s children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such is, in brief, the substance of the earliest life of Homer we\n",
      "possess, and so broad are the evidences of its historical\n",
      "worthlessness, that it is scarcely necessary to point them out in\n",
      "detail. Let us now consider some of the opinions to which a\n",
      "persevering, patient, and learned—but by no means consistent—series of\n",
      "investigations has led. In doing so, I profess to bring forward\n",
      "statements, not to vouch for their reasonableness or probability.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Homer appeared. The history of this poet and his works is lost in\n",
      "doubtful obscurity, as is the history of many of the first minds who\n",
      "have done honour to humanity, because they rose amidst darkness. The\n",
      "majestic stream of his song, blessing and fertilizing, flows like the\n",
      "Nile, through many lands and nations; and, like the sources of the\n",
      "Nile, its fountains will ever remain concealed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Such are the words in which one of the most judicious German critics\n",
      "has eloquently described the uncertainty in which the whole of the\n",
      "Homeric question is involved. With no less truth and feeling he\n",
      "proceeds:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“It seems here of chief importance to expect no more than the nature of\n",
      "things makes possible. If the period of tradition in history is the\n",
      "region of twilight, we should not expect in it perfect light. The\n",
      "creations of genius always seem like miracles, because they are, for\n",
      "the most part, created far out of the reach of observation. If we were\n",
      "in possession of all the historical testimonies, we never could wholly\n",
      "explain the origin of the Iliad and the Odyssey; for their origin, in\n",
      "all essential points, must have remained the secret of the poet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "From this criticism, which shows as much insight into the depths of\n",
      "human nature as into the minute wire-drawings of scholastic\n",
      "investigation, let us pass on to the main question at issue. Was Homer\n",
      "an individual? or were the Iliad and Odyssey the result of an ingenious\n",
      "arrangement of fragments by earlier poets?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well has Landor remarked: “Some tell us there were twenty Homers; some\n",
      "deny that there was ever one. It were idle and foolish to shake the\n",
      "contents of a vase, in order to let them settle at last. We are\n",
      "perpetually labouring to destroy our delights, our composure, our\n",
      "devotion to superior power. Of all the animals on earth we least know\n",
      "what is good for us. My opinion is, that what is best for us is our\n",
      "admiration of good. No man living venerates Homer more than I do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But, greatly as we admire the generous enthusiasm which rests contented\n",
      "with the poetry on which its best impulses had been nurtured and\n",
      "fostered, without seeking to destroy the vividness of first impressions\n",
      "by minute analysis, our editorial office compels us to give some\n",
      "attention to the doubts and difficulties with which the Homeric\n",
      "question is beset, and to entreat our reader, for a brief period, to\n",
      "prefer his judgment to his imagination, and to condescend to dry\n",
      "details. Before, however, entering into particulars respecting the\n",
      "question of this unity of the Homeric poems, (at least of the Iliad,) I\n",
      "must express my sympathy with the sentiments expressed in the following\n",
      "remarks:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“We cannot but think the universal admiration of its unity by the\n",
      "better, the poetic age of Greece, almost conclusive testimony to its\n",
      "original composition. It was not till the age of the grammarians that\n",
      "its primitive integrity was called in question; nor is it injustice to\n",
      "assert, that the minute and analytical spirit of a grammarian is not\n",
      "the best qualification for the profound feeling, the comprehensive\n",
      "conception of an harmonious whole. The most exquisite anatomist may be\n",
      "no judge of the symmetry of the human frame; and we would take the\n",
      "opinion of Chantrey or Westmacott on the proportions and general beauty\n",
      "of a form, rather than that of Mr. Brodie or Sir Astley Cooper.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is some truth, though some malicious exaggeration, in the lines\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Long was the time which elapsed before any one dreamt of questioning\n",
      "the unity of the authorship of the Homeric poems. The grave and\n",
      "cautious Thucydides quoted without hesitation the Hymn to Apollo, the\n",
      "authenticity of which has been already disclaimed by modern critics.\n",
      "Longinus, in an oft-quoted passage, merely expressed an opinion\n",
      "touching the comparative inferiority of the Odyssey to the Iliad; and,\n",
      "among a mass of ancient authors, whose very names it would be tedious\n",
      "to detail, no suspicion of the personal non-existence of Homer ever\n",
      "arose. So far, the voice of antiquity seems to be in favour of our\n",
      "early ideas on the subject: let us now see what are the discoveries to\n",
      "which more modern investigations lay claim.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the seventeenth century, doubts had begun to awaken on\n",
      "the subject, and we find Bentley remarking that “Homer wrote a sequel\n",
      "of songs and rhapsodies, to be sung by himself, for small comings and\n",
      "good cheer, at festivals and other days of merriment. These loose songs\n",
      "were not collected together, in the form of an epic poem, till about\n",

      "\n",

      "first meet with the germ of the theory, subsequently defended by Wolf\n",
      "with so much learning and acuteness. Indeed, it is with the Wolfian\n",
      "theory that we have chiefly to deal, and with the following bold\n",
      "hypothesis, which we will detail in the words of Grote:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Half a century ago, the acute and valuable Prolegomena of F. A. Wolf,\n",
      "turning to account the Venetian Scholia, which had then been recently\n",
      "published, first opened philosophical discussion as to the history of\n",
      "the Homeric text. A considerable part of that dissertation (though by\n",
      "no means the whole) is employed in vindicating the position, previously\n",
      "announced by Bentley, amongst others, that the separate constituent\n",
      "portions of the Iliad and Odyssey had not been cemented together into\n",
      "any compact body and unchangeable order, until the days of\n",
      "Peisistratus, in the sixth century before Christ. As a step towards\n",
      "that conclusion, Wolf maintained that no written copies of either poem\n",
      "could be shown to have existed during the earlier times, to which their\n",
      "composition is referred; and that without writing, neither the perfect\n",
      "symmetry of so complicated a work could have been originally conceived\n",
      "by any poet, nor, if realized by him, transmitted with assurance to\n",
      "posterity. The absence of easy and convenient writing, such as must be\n",
      "indispensably supposed for long manuscripts, among the early Greeks,\n",
      "was thus one of the points in Wolf’s case against the primitive\n",
      "integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey. By Nitzsch, and other leading\n",
      "opponents of Wolf, the connection of the one with the other seems to\n",
      "have been accepted as he originally put it; and it has been considered\n",
      "incumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate character of the\n",
      "Iliad and Odyssey, to maintain that they were written poems from the\n",
      "beginning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To me it appears, that the architectonic functions ascribed by Wolf to\n",
      "Peisistratus and his associates, in reference to the Homeric poems, are\n",
      "nowise admissible. But much would undoubtedly be gained towards that\n",
      "view of the question, if it could be shown, that, in order to\n",
      "controvert it, we were driven to the necessity of admitting long\n",
      "written poems, in the ninth century before the Christian aera. Few\n",
      "things, in my opinion, can be more improbable; and Mr. Payne Knight,\n",
      "opposed as he is to the Wolfian hypothesis, admits this no less than\n",
      "Wolf himself. The traces of writing in Greece, even in the seventh\n",
      "century before the Christian aera, are exceedingly trifling. We have no\n",
      "remaining inscription earlier than the fortieth Olympiad, and the early\n",
      "inscriptions are rude and unskilfully executed; nor can we even assure\n",
      "ourselves whether Archilochus, Simonides of Amorgus, Kallinus Tyrtaeus,\n",
      "Xanthus, and the other early elegiac and lyric poets, committed their\n",
      "compositions to writing, or at what time the practice of doing so\n",
      "became familiar. The first positive ground which authorizes us to\n",
      "presume the existence of a manuscript of Homer, is in the famous\n",
      "ordinance of Solon, with regard to the rhapsodies at the Panathenaea:\n",

      "unable to say.\n",

      "“Those who maintain the Homeric poems to have been written from the\n",
      "beginning, rest their case, not upon positive proofs, nor yet upon the\n",
      "existing habits of society with regard to poetry—for they admit\n",
      "generally that the Iliad and Odyssey were not read, but recited and\n",
      "heard,—but upon the supposed necessity that there must have been\n",
      "manuscripts to ensure the preservation of the poems—the unassisted\n",

      "we only escape a smaller difficulty by running into a greater; for the\n",
      "existence of trained bards, gifted with extraordinary memory, is far\n",
      "less astonishing than that of long manuscripts, in an age essentially\n",
      "non-reading and non-writing, and when even suitable instruments and\n",
      "materials for the process are not obvious. Moreover, there is a strong\n",
      "positive reason for believing that the bard was under no necessity of\n",
      "refreshing his memory by consulting a manuscript; for if such had been\n",
      "the fact, blindness would have been a disqualification for the\n",
      "profession, which we know that it was not, as well from the example of\n",
      "Demodokus, in the Odyssey, as from that of the blind bard of Chios, in\n",
      "the Hymn to the Delian Apollo, whom Thucydides, as well as the general\n",
      "tenor of Grecian legend, identifies with Homer himself. The author of\n",
      "that hymn, be he who he may, could never have described a blind man as\n",
      "attaining the utmost perfection in his art, if he had been conscious\n",
      "that the memory of the bard was only maintained by constant reference\n",
      "to the manuscript in his chest.”\n",

      "The loss of the digamma, that _crux_ of critics, that quicksand upon\n",
      "which even the acumen of Bentley was shipwrecked, seems to prove beyond\n",
      "a doubt, that the pronunciation of the Greek language had undergone a\n",
      "considerable change. Now it is certainly difficult to suppose that the\n",
      "Homeric poems could have suffered by this change, had written copies\n",

      "“At what period,” continues Grote, “these poems, or indeed any other\n",
      "Greek poems, first began to be written, must be matter of conjecture,\n",
      "though there is ground for assurance that it was before the time of\n",
      "Solon. If, in the absence of evidence, we may venture upon naming any\n",
      "more determinate period, the question at once suggests itself, What\n",
      "were the purposes which, in that state of society, a manuscript at its\n",
      "first commencement must have been intended to answer? For whom was a\n",
      "written Iliad necessary? Not for the rhapsodes; for with them it was\n",
      "not only planted in the memory, but also interwoven with the feelings,\n",
      "and conceived in conjunction with all those flexions and intonations of\n",
      "voice, pauses, and other oral artifices which were required for\n",
      "emphatic delivery, and which the naked manuscript could never\n",
      "reproduce. Not for the general public—they were accustomed to receive\n",
      "it with its rhapsodic delivery, and with its accompaniments of a solemn\n",
      "and crowded festival. The only persons for whom the written Iliad would\n",
      "be suitable would be a select few; studious and curious men; a class of\n",
      "readers capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they had\n",
      "experienced as hearers in the crowd, and who would, on perusing the\n",
      "written words, realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of the\n",
      "impression communicated by the reciter. Incredible as the statement may\n",
      "seem in an age like the present, there is in all early societies, and\n",
      "there was in early Greece, a time when no such reading class existed.\n",
      "If we could discover at what time such a class first began to be\n",
      "formed, we should be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic\n",
      "poems were first committed to writing. Now the period which may with\n",
      "the greatest probability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the\n",
      "formation even of the narrowest reading class in Greece, is the middle\n",
      "of the seventh century before the Christian aera (B.C. 660 to B.C.\n",
      "630), the age of Terpander, Kallinus, Archilochus, Simenides of\n",
      "Amorgus, &c. I ground this supposition on the change then operated in\n",
      "the character and tendencies of Grecian poetry and music—the elegiac\n",
      "and the iambic measures having been introduced as rivals to the\n",
      "primitive hexameter, and poetical compositions having been transferred\n",
      "from the epical past to the affairs of present and real life. Such a\n",
      "change was important at a time when poetry was the only known mode of\n",
      "publication (to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable, yet the\n",
      "nearest approaching to the sense). It argued a new way of looking at\n",
      "the old epical treasures of the people, as well as a thirst for new\n",
      "poetical effect; and the men who stood forward in it may well be\n",
      "considered as desirous to study, and competent to criticize, from their\n",
      "own individual point of view, the written words of the Homeric\n",
      "rhapsodies, just as we are told that Kallinus both noticed and\n",
      "eulogized the Thebais as the production of Homer. There seems,\n",
      "therefore, ground for conjecturing that (for the use of this\n",
      "newly-formed and important, but very narrow class), manuscripts of the\n",
      "Homeric poems and other old epics,—the Thebais and the Cypria, as well\n",

      "the number of manuscripts along with it: so that before the time of\n",
      "Solon, fifty years afterwards, both readers and manuscripts, though\n",
      "still comparatively few, might have attained a certain recognized\n",

      "compilation, at least over the theory that the Iliad was cast into its\n",
      "present stately and harmonious form by the directions of the Athenian\n",

      "must have been done to arrange, to connect, to harmonize, that it is\n",
      "almost incredible that stronger marks of Athenian manufacture should\n",
      "not remain. Whatever occasional anomalies may be detected, anomalies\n",
      "which no doubt arise out of our own ignorance of the language of the\n",
      "Homeric age; however the irregular use of the digamma may have\n",
      "perplexed our Bentleys, to whom the name of Helen is said to have\n",

      "heroes of her age; however Mr. Knight may have failed in reducing the\n",
      "Homeric language to its primitive form; however, finally, the Attic\n",
      "dialect may not have assumed all its more marked and distinguishing\n",
      "characteristics:—still it is difficult to suppose that the language,\n",
      "particularly in the joinings and transitions, and connecting parts,\n",
      "should not more clearly betray the incongruity between the more ancient\n",

      "undertaken the task of piecing together many self-existent epics into\n",
      "one large aggregate. Everything in the two great Homeric poems, both in\n",
      "substance and in language, belongs to an age two or three centuries\n",
      "earlier than Peisistratus. Indeed, even the interpolations (or those\n",
      "passages which, on the best grounds, are pronounced to be such) betray\n",
      "no trace of the sixth century before Christ, and may well have been\n",
      "heard by Archilochus and Kallinus—in some cases even by Arktinus and\n",
      "Hesiod—as genuine Homeric matter. As far as the evidences on the case,\n",

      "On the whole, I am inclined to believe, that the labours of\n",
      "Peisistratus were wholly of an editorial character, although I must\n",

      "or primary arrangement of these poems, in their present form, was the\n",
      "work of Peisistratus, I am rather persuaded that the fine taste and\n",

      "I will conclude this sketch of the Homeric theories with an attempt,\n",
      "made by an ingenious friend, to unite them into something like\n",
      "consistency. It is as follows:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“No doubt the common soldiers of that age had, like the common sailors\n",
      "of some fifty years ago, some one qualified to ‘discourse in excellent\n",
      "music’ among them. Many of these, like those of the negroes in the\n",
      "United States, were extemporaneous, and allusive to events passing\n",
      "around them. But what was passing around them? The grand events of a\n",
      "spirit-stirring war; occurrences likely to impress themselves, as the\n",
      "mystical legends of former times had done, upon their memory; besides\n",
      "which, a retentive memory was deemed a virtue of the first water, and\n",
      "was cultivated accordingly in those ancient times. Ballads at first,\n",
      "and down to the beginning of the war with Troy, were merely\n",
      "recitations, with an intonation. Then followed a species of recitative,\n",
      "probably with an intoned burden. Tune next followed, as it aided the\n",
      "memory considerably.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was at this period, about four hundred years after the war, that a\n",
      "poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes, or Moeonides, but most\n",
      "probably the former. He saw that these ballads might be made of great\n",
      "utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of\n",
      "Hellas, and, as a collection, he published these lays connecting them\n",
      "by a tale of his own. This poem now exists, under the title of the\n",
      "‘Odyssea.’ The author, however, did not affix his own name to the poem,\n",
      "which, in fact, was, great part of it, remodelled from the archaic\n",
      "dialect of Crete, in which tongue the ballads were found by him. He\n",
      "therefore called it the poem of Homeros, or the Collector; but this is\n",
      "rather a proof of his modesty and talent, than of his mere drudging\n",
      "arrangement of other people’s ideas; for, as Grote has finely observed,\n",
      "arguing for the unity of authorship, ‘a great poet might have re-cast\n",
      "pre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole; but no mere\n",
      "arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“While employed on the wild legend of Odysseus, he met with a ballad,\n",
      "recording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon. His noble mind seized\n",
      "the hint that there presented itself, and the Achilleis grew under his\n",
      "hand. Unity of design, however, caused him to publish the poem under\n",
      "the same pseudonyme as his former work; and the disjointed lays of the\n",
      "ancient bards were joined together, like those relating to the Cid,\n",
      "into a chronicle history, named the Iliad. Melesigenes knew that the\n",
      "poem was destined to be a lasting one, and so it has proved; but,\n",
      "first, the poems were destined to undergo many vicissitudes and\n",
      "corruptions, by the people who took to singing them in the streets,\n",
      "assemblies, and agoras. However, Solon first, and then Peisistratus,\n",
      "and afterwards Aristoteles and others, revised the poems, and restored\n",
      "the works of Melesigenes Homeros to their original integrity in a great\n",

      "\n",
      "Having thus given some general notion of the strange theories which\n",

      "disfigure them, and that the intrusive hand of the poetasters may here\n",

      "their one author, be he Homer or Melesigenes, _quocunque nomine vocari\n",
      "eum jus fasque sit_, I feel conscious that, while the whole weight of\n",
      "historical evidence is against the hypothesis which would assign these\n",
      "great works to a plurality of authors, the most powerful internal\n",
      "evidence, and that which springs from the deepest and most immediate\n",
      "impulse of the soul, also speaks eloquently to the contrary.\n",
      "\n",
      "The minutiae of verbal criticism I am far from seeking to despise.\n",
      "Indeed, considering the character of some of my own books, such an\n",
      "attempt would be gross inconsistency. But, while I appreciate its\n",
      "importance in a philological view, I am inclined to set little store on\n",
      "its aesthetic value, especially in poetry. Three parts of the\n",
      "emendations made upon poets are mere alterations, some of which, had\n",
      "they been suggested to the author by his Maecenas or Africanus, he\n",
      "would probably have adopted. Moreover, those who are most exact in\n",
      "laying down rules of verbal criticism and interpretation, are often\n",
      "least competent to carry out their own precepts. Grammarians are not\n",
      "poets by profession, but may be so _per accidens_. I do not at this\n",
      "moment remember two emendations on Homer, calculated to substantially\n",
      "improve the poetry of a passage, although a mass of remarks, from\n",
      "Herodotus down to Loewe, have given us the history of a thousand minute\n",
      "points, without which our Greek knowledge would be gloomy and jejune.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it is not on words only that grammarians, mere grammarians, will\n",
      "exercise their elaborate and often tiresome ingenuity. Binding down an\n",
      "heroic or dramatic poet to the block upon which they have previously\n",
      "dissected his words and sentences, they proceed to use the axe and the\n",
      "pruning knife by wholesale; and, inconsistent in everything but their\n",
      "wish to make out a case of unlawful affiliation, they cut out book\n",

      "collection of fragments, or till those who fancied they possessed the\n",
      "works of some great man, find that they have been put off with a vile\n",
      "counterfeit got up at second hand. If we compare the theories of\n",
      "Knight, Wolf, Lachmann; and others, we shall feel better satisfied of\n",

      "Nor is this morbid species of sagacity by any means to be looked upon\n",
      "as a literary novelty. Justus Lipsius, a scholar of no ordinary skill,\n",
      "seems to revel in the imaginary discovery, that the tragedies\n",

      "freedom from real poetry, and last, but not least, in an ultra-refined\n",

      "present day would question the capabilities of the same gentleman, be\n",
      "he Seneca or not, to produce not only these, but a great many more\n",

      "refined acuteness—which scholars like Wolf have bestowed upon this\n",
      "subject, I must express my fears, that many of our modern Homeric\n",
      "theories will become matter for the surprise and entertainment, rather\n",

      "I have already expressed my belief that the labours of Peisistratus\n",
      "were of a purely editorial character; and there seems no more reason\n",

      "his day, than that the poems of Valerius Flaccus and Tibullus should\n",
      "have given so much trouble to Poggio, Scaliger, and others. But, after\n",
      "all, the main fault in all the Homeric theories is, that they demand\n",
      "too great a sacrifice of those feelings to which poetry most powerfully\n",
      "appeals, and which are its most fitting judges. The ingenuity which has\n",
      "sought to rob us of the name and existence of Homer, does too much\n",
      "violence to that inward emotion, which makes our whole soul yearn with\n",
      "love and admiration for the blind bard of Chios. To believe the author\n",
      "of the Iliad a mere compiler, is to degrade the powers of human\n",
      "invention; to elevate analytical judgment at the expense of the most\n",
      "ennobling impulses of the soul; and to forget the ocean in the\n",
      "contemplation of a polypus. There is a catholicity, so to speak, in the\n",

      "round the bed of the poet, and even bestows rare gifts from that wealth\n",
      "of imagination which a host of imitators could not exhaust,—still I am\n",
      "far from wishing to deny that the author of these great poems found a\n",
      "rich fund of tradition, a well-stocked mythical storehouse, from whence\n",

      "impressions—nay, even his own thoughts are a kind of secondary agents\n",
      "which support and feed the impulses of imagination. But unless there be\n",

      "know or care about that department of criticism employed in determining\n",

      "disposition to be satisfied with the general sense, rather than to dive\n",
      "deeply into the minute and delicate features of language. Hence his\n",
      "whole work is to be looked upon rather as an elegant paraphrase than a\n",
      "translation. There are, to be sure, certain conventional anecdotes,\n",
      "which prove that Pope consulted various friends, whose classical\n",
      "attainments were sounder than his own, during the undertaking; but it\n",
      "is probable that these examinations were the result rather of the\n",
      "contradictory versions already existing, than of a desire to make a\n",
      "perfect transcript of the original. And in those days, what is called\n",
      "literal translation was less cultivated than at present. If something\n",
      "like the general sense could be decorated with the easy gracefulness of\n",
      "a practised poet; if the charms of metrical cadence and a pleasing\n",
      "fluency could be made consistent with a fair interpretation of the\n",
      "poet’s meaning, his words were less jealously sought for, and those who\n",

      "Nestor relates what passed in their return from Troy, how their fleets\n",
      "were separated, and he never since heard of Ulysses. They discourse\n",
      "concerning the death of Agamemnon, the revenge of Orestes, and the\n",
      "injuries of the suitors. Nestor advises him to go to Sparta, and\n",
      "inquire further of Menelaus. The sacrifice ending with the night,\n",

      "Ulysses arrives in disguise at the house of Eumaeus, where he is\n",
      "received, entertained, and lodged with the utmost hospitality. The\n",
      "several discourses of that faithful old servant, with the feigned story\n",
      "told by Ulysses to conceal himself, and other conversations on various\n",
      "subjects, take up this entire book.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But he, deep-musing, o’er the mountains stray’d\n",
      "Through mazy thickets of the woodland shade,\n",
      "And cavern’d ways, the shaggy coast along\n",
      "With cliffs and nodding forests overhung.\n",
      "Eumaeus at his sylvan lodge he sought,\n",
      "A faithful servant, and without a fault.\n",
      "Ulysses found him busied as he sate\n",
      "Before the threshold of his rustic gate;\n",
      "Around the mansion in a circle shone\n",
      "A rural portico of rugged stone\n",
      "(In absence of his lord with honest toil\n",
      "His own industrious hands had raised the pile).\n",
      "The wall was stone from neighbouring quarries borne,\n",
      "Encircled with a fence of native thorn,\n",
      "And strong with pales, by many a weary stroke\n",
      "Of stubborn labour hewn from heart of oak:\n",
      "Frequent and thick. Within the space were rear’d\n",
      "Twelve ample cells, the lodgments of his herd.\n",
      "Full fifty pregnant females each contain’d;\n",
      "The males without (a smaller race) remain’d;\n",
      "Doom’d to supply the suitors’ wasteful feast,\n",
      "A stock by daily luxury decreased;\n",
      "Now scarce four hundred left. These to defend,\n",
      "Four savage dogs, a watchful guard, attend.\n",
      "Here sat Eumaeus, and his cares applied\n",
      "To form strong buskins of well-season’d hide.\n",
      "Of four assistants who his labour share,\n",
      "Three now were absent on the rural care;\n",
      "The fourth drove victims to a suitor train:\n",
      "But he, of ancient faith, a simple swain,\n",
      "Sigh’d, while he furnish’d the luxurious board,\n",
      "And wearied Heaven with wishes for his lord.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon as Ulysses near the inclosure drew,\n",
      "With open mouths the furious mastiffs flew:\n",
      "Down sat the sage, and cautious to withstand,\n",
      "Let fall the offensive truncheon from his hand.\n",
      "Sudden, the master runs; aloud he calls;\n",
      "And from his hasty hand the leather falls:\n",
      "With showers of stones he drives then far away:\n",
      "The scattering dogs around at distance bay.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Unhappy stranger! (thus the faithful swain\n",
      "Began with accent gracious and humane),\n",
      "What sorrow had been mine, if at my gate\n",
      "Thy reverend age had met a shameful fate!\n",
      "Enough of woes already have I known;\n",
      "Enough my master’s sorrows and my own.\n",
      "While here (ungrateful task!) his herds I feed,\n",
      "Ordain’d for lawless rioters to bleed!\n",
      "Perhaps, supported at another’s board!\n",
      "Far from his country roams my hapless lord;\n",
      "Or sigh’d in exile forth his latest breath,\n",
      "Now cover’d with the eternal shade of death!\n",
      "\n",
      "“But enter this my homely roof, and see\n",
      "Our woods not void of hospitality.\n",
      "Then tell me whence thou art, and what the share\n",
      "Of woes and wanderings thou wert born to bear.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He said, and, seconding the kind request,\n",
      "With friendly step precedes his unknown guest.\n",
      "A shaggy goat’s soft hide beneath him spread,\n",
      "And with fresh rushes heap’d an ample bed;\n",
      "Jove touch’d the hero’s tender soul, to find\n",
      "So just reception from a heart so kind:\n",
      "And “Oh, ye gods! with all your blessings grace\n",
      "(He thus broke forth) this friend of human race!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The swain replied: “It never was our guise\n",
      "To slight the poor, or aught humane despise:\n",
      "For Jove unfolds our hospitable door,\n",
      "’Tis Jove that sends the stranger and the poor,\n",
      "Little, alas! is all the good I can\n",
      "A man oppress’d, dependent, yet a man:\n",
      "Accept such treatment as a swain affords,\n",
      "Slave to the insolence of youthful lords!\n",
      "Far hence is by unequal gods removed\n",
      "That man of bounties, loving and beloved!\n",
      "To whom whate’er his slave enjoys is owed,\n",
      "And more, had Fate allow’d, had been bestow’d:\n",
      "But Fate condemn’d him to a foreign shore;\n",
      "Much have I sorrow’d, but my Master more.\n",
      "Now cold he lies, to death’s embrace resign’d:\n",
      "Ah, perish Helen! perish all her kind!\n",
      "For whose cursed cause, in Agamemnon’s name,\n",
      "He trod so fatally the paths of fame.”\n",
      "\n",
      "His vest succinct then girding round his waist,\n",
      "Forth rush’d the swain with hospitable haste.\n",
      "Straight to the lodgments of his herd he run,\n",
      "Where the fat porkers slept beneath the sun;\n",
      "Of two, his cutlass launch’d the spouting blood;\n",
      "These quarter’d, singed, and fix’d on forks of wood,\n",
      "All hasty on the hissing coals he threw;\n",
      "And smoking, back the tasteful viands drew.\n",
      "Broachers and all then an the board display’d\n",
      "The ready meal, before Ulysses laid\n",
      "With flour imbrown’d; next mingled wine yet new,\n",
      "And luscious as the bees’ nectareous dew:\n",
      "Then sate, companion of the friendly feast,\n",
      "With open look; and thus bespoke his guest:\n",
      "“Take with free welcome what our hands prepare,\n",
      "Such food as falls to simple servants’ share;\n",
      "The best our lords consume; those thoughtless peers,\n",
      "Rich without bounty, guilty without fears;\n",
      "Yet sure the gods their impious acts detest,\n",
      "And honour justice and the righteous breast.\n",
      "Pirates and conquerors of harden’d mind,\n",
      "The foes of peace, and scourges of mankind,\n",
      "To whom offending men are made a prey\n",
      "When Jove in vengeance gives a land away;\n",
      "E’en these, when of their ill-got spoils possess’d,\n",
      "Find sure tormentors in the guilty breast:\n",
      "Some voice of God close whispering from within,\n",
      "‘Wretch! this is villainy, and this is sin.’\n",
      "But these, no doubt, some oracle explore,\n",
      "That tells, the great Ulysses is no more.\n",
      "Hence springs their confidence, and from our sighs\n",
      "Their rapine strengthens, and their riots rise:\n",
      "Constant as Jove the night and day bestows,\n",
      "Bleeds a whole hecatomb, a vintage flows.\n",
      "None match’d this hero’s wealth, of all who reign\n",
      "O’er the fair islands of the neighbouring main.\n",
      "Nor all the monarchs whose far-dreaded sway\n",
      "The wide-extended continents obey:\n",
      "First, on the main land, of Ulysses’ breed\n",
      "Twelve herds, twelve flocks, on ocean’s margin feed;\n",
      "As many stalls for shaggy goats are rear’d;\n",
      "As many lodgments for the tusky herd;\n",
      "Two foreign keepers guard: and here are seen\n",
      "Twelve herds of goats that graze our utmost green;\n",
      "To native pastors is their charge assign’d,\n",
      "And mine the care to feed the bristly kind;\n",
      "Each day the fattest bleeds of either herd,\n",
      "All to the suitors’ wasteful board preferr’d.”\n",
      "Thus he, benevolent: his unknown guest\n",
      "With hunger keen devours the savoury feast;\n",
      "While schemes of vengeance ripen in his breast.\n",
      "Silent and thoughtful while the board he eyed,\n",
      "Eumaeus pours on high the purple tide;\n",
      "The king with smiling looks his joy express’d,\n",
      "And thus the kind inviting host address’d:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say now, what man is he, the man deplored,\n",
      "So rich, so potent, whom you style your lord?\n",
      "Late with such affluence and possessions bless’d,\n",
      "And now in honour’s glorious bed at rest.\n",
      "Whoever was the warrior, he must be\n",
      "To fame no stranger, nor perhaps to me:\n",
      "Who (so the gods and so the Fates ordain’d)\n",
      "Have wander’d many a sea, and many a land.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Small is the faith the prince and queen ascribe\n",
      "(Replied Eumaeus) to the wandering tribe.\n",
      "For needy strangers still to flattery fly,\n",
      "And want too oft betrays the tongue to lie.\n",
      "Each vagrant traveller, that touches here,\n",
      "Deludes with fallacies the royal ear,\n",
      "To dear remembrance makes his image rise,\n",
      "And calls the springing sorrows from her eyes.\n",
      "Such thou mayst be. But he whose name you crave\n",
      "Moulders in earth, or welters on the wave,\n",
      "Or food for fish or dogs his relics lie,\n",
      "Or torn by birds are scatter’d through the sky.\n",
      "So perish’d he: and left (for ever lost)\n",
      "Much woe to all, but sure to me the most.\n",
      "So mild a master never shall I find;\n",
      "Less dear the parents whom I left behind,\n",
      "Less soft my mother, less my father kind.\n",
      "Not with such transport would my eyes run o’er,\n",
      "Again to hail them in their native shore,\n",
      "As loved Ulysses once more to embrace,\n",
      "Restored and breathing in his natal place.\n",
      "That name for ever dread, yet ever dear,\n",
      "E’en in his absence I pronounce with fear:\n",
      "In my respect, he bears a prince’s part;\n",
      "But lives a very brother in my heart.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus spoke the faithful swain, and thus rejoin’d\n",
      "The master of his grief, the man of patient mind:\n",
      "“Ulysses, friend! shall view his old abodes\n",
      "(Distrustful as thou art), nor doubt the gods.\n",
      "Nor speak I rashly, but with faith averr’d,\n",
      "And what I speak attesting Heaven has heard.\n",
      "If so, a cloak and vesture be my meed:\n",
      "Till his return no title shall I plead,\n",
      "Though certain be my news, and great my need.\n",
      "Whom want itself can force untruths to tell,\n",
      "My soul detests him as the gates of hell.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou first be witness, hospitable Jove!\n",
      "And every god inspiring social love!\n",
      "And witness every household power that waits,\n",
      "Guard of these fires, and angel of these gates!\n",
      "Ere the next moon increase or this decay,\n",
      "His ancient realms Ulysses shall survey,\n",
      "In blood and dust each proud oppressor mourn,\n",
      "And the lost glories of his house return.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nor shall that meed be thine, nor ever more\n",
      "Shall loved Ulysses hail this happy shore.\n",
      "(Replied Eumaeus): to the present hour\n",
      "Now turn thy thought, and joys within our power.\n",
      "From sad reflection let my soul repose;\n",
      "The name of him awakes a thousand woes.\n",
      "But guard him, gods! and to these arms restore!\n",
      "Not his true consort can desire him more;\n",
      "Not old Laertes, broken with despair:\n",
      "Not young Telemachus, his blooming heir.\n",
      "Alas, Telemachus! my sorrows flow\n",
      "Afresh for thee, my second cause of woe!\n",
      "Like some fair plant set by a heavenly hand,\n",
      "He grew, he flourish’d, and he bless’d the land;\n",
      "In all the youth his father’s image shined,\n",
      "Bright in his person, brighter in his mind.\n",
      "What man, or god, deceived his better sense,\n",
      "Far on the swelling seas to wander hence?\n",
      "To distant Pylos hapless is he gone,\n",
      "To seek his father’s fate and find his own!\n",
      "For traitors wait his way, with dire design\n",
      "To end at once the great Arcesian line.\n",
      "But let us leave him to their wills above;\n",
      "The fates of men are in the hand of Jove.\n",
      "And now, my venerable guest! declare\n",
      "Your name, your parents, and your native air:\n",
      "Sincere from whence begun, your course relate,\n",
      "And to what ship I owe the friendly freight?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus he: and thus (with prompt invention bold)\n",
      "The cautious chief his ready story told.\n",
      "\n",
      "“On dark reserve what better can prevail,\n",
      "Or from the fluent tongue produce the tale,\n",
      "Than when two friends, alone, in peaceful place\n",
      "Confer, and wines and cates the table grace;\n",
      "But most, the kind inviter’s cheerful face?\n",
      "Thus might we sit, with social goblets crown’d,\n",
      "Till the whole circle of the year goes round:\n",
      "Not the whole circle of the year would close\n",
      "My long narration of a life of woes.\n",
      "But such was Heaven’s high will! Know then, I came\n",
      "From sacred Crete, and from a sire of fame:\n",
      "Castor Hylacides (that name he bore),\n",
      "Beloved and honour’d in his native shore;\n",
      "Bless’d in his riches, in his children more.\n",
      "Sprung of a handmaid, from a bought embrace,\n",
      "I shared his kindness with his lawful race:\n",
      "But when that fate, which all must undergo,\n",
      "From earth removed him to the shades below,\n",
      "The large domain his greedy sons divide,\n",
      "And each was portion’d as the lots decide.\n",
      "Little, alas! was left my wretched share,\n",
      "Except a house, a covert from the air:\n",
      "But what by niggard fortune was denied,\n",
      "A willing widow’s copious wealth supplied.\n",
      "My valour was my plea, a gallant mind,\n",
      "That, true to honour, never lagg’d behind\n",
      "(The sex is ever to a soldier kind).\n",
      "Now wasting years my former strength confound,\n",
      "And added woes have bow’d me to the ground;\n",
      "Yet by the stubble you may guess the grain,\n",
      "And mark the ruins of no vulgar man.\n",
      "Me, Pallas gave to lead the martial storm,\n",
      "And the fair ranks of battle to deform;\n",
      "Me, Mars inspired to turn the foe to flight,\n",
      "And tempt the secret ambush of the night.\n",
      "Let ghastly Death in all his forms appear,\n",
      "I saw him not, it was not mine to fear.\n",
      "Before the rest I raised my ready steel,\n",
      "The first I met, he yielded, or he fell.\n",
      "But works of peace my soul disdain’d to bear,\n",
      "The rural labour, or domestic care.\n",
      "To raise the mast, the missile dart to wing,\n",
      "And send swift arrows from the bounding string,\n",
      "Were arts the gods made grateful to my mind;\n",
      "Those gods, who turn (to various ends design’d)\n",
      "The various thoughts and talents of mankind.\n",
      "Before the Grecians touch’d the Trojan plain,\n",
      "Nine times commander or by land or main,\n",
      "In foreign fields I spread my glory far,\n",
      "Great in the praise, rich in the spoils of war;\n",
      "Thence charged with riches, as increased in fame,\n",
      "To Crete return’d, an honourable name.\n",
      "But when great Jove that direful war decreed,\n",
      "Which roused all Greece, and made the mighty bleed;\n",
      "Our states myself and Idomen employ\n",
      "To lead their fleets, and carry death to Troy.\n",
      "Nine years we warr’d; the tenth saw Ilion fall;\n",
      "Homeward we sail’d, but heaven dispersed us all.\n",
      "One only month my wife enjoy’d my stay;\n",
      "So will’d the god who gives and takes away.\n",
      "Nine ships I mann’d, equipp’d with ready stores,\n",
      "Intent to voyage to the Ægyptian shores;\n",
      "In feast and sacrifice my chosen train\n",
      "Six days consum’d; the seventh we plough’d the main.\n",
      "Crete’s ample fields diminish to our eye;\n",
      "Before the Boreal blast the vessels fly;\n",
      "Safe through the level seas we sweep our way;\n",
      "The steersman governs, and the ships obey.\n",
      "The fifth fair morn we stem the Ægyptian tide,\n",
      "And tilting o’er the bay the vessels ride:\n",
      "To anchor there my fellows I command,\n",
      "And spies commission to explore the land.\n",
      "But, sway’d by lust of gain, and headlong will,\n",
      "The coasts they ravage, and the natives kill.\n",
      "The spreading clamour to their city flies,\n",
      "And horse and foot in mingled tumult rise.\n",
      "The reddening dawn reveals the circling fields,\n",
      "Horrid with bristly spears, and glancing shields.\n",
      "Jove thunder’d on their side. Our guilty head\n",
      "We turn’d to flight; the gathering vengeance spread\n",
      "On all parts round, and heaps on heaps lie dead.\n",
      "I then explored my thought, what course to prove\n",
      "(And sure the thought was dictated by Jove):\n",
      "Oh, had he left me to that happier doom,\n",
      "And saved a life of miseries to come!\n",
      "The radiant helmet from my brows unlaced,\n",
      "And low on earth my shield and javelin cast,\n",
      "I meet the monarch with a suppliant’s face,\n",
      "Approach his chariot, and his knees embrace,\n",
      "He heard, he saved, he placed me at his side;\n",
      "My state he pitied, and my tears he dried,\n",
      "Restrain’d the rage the vengeful foe express’d,\n",
      "And turn’d the deadly weapons from my breast.\n",
      "Pious! to guard the hospitable rite,\n",
      "And fearing Jove, whom mercy’s works delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In Ægypt thus with peace and plenty bless’d,\n",

      "On seven bright years successive blessings wait;\n",
      "The next changed all the colour of my fate.\n",
      "A false Phoenician, of insiduous mind,\n",
      "Versed in vile arts, and foe to humankind,\n",
      "With semblance fair invites me to his home;\n",
      "I seized the proffer (ever fond to roam):\n",
      "Domestic in his faithless roof I stay’d,\n",
      "Till the swift sun his annual circle made.\n",
      "To Libya then he mediates the way;\n",
      "With guileful art a stranger to betray,\n",
      "And sell to bondage in a foreign land:\n",
      "Much doubting, yet compell’d I quit the strand,\n",
      "Through the mid seas the nimble pinnace sails,\n",
      "Aloof from Crete, before the northern gales:\n",
      "But when remote her chalky cliffs we lost,\n",
      "And far from ken of any other coast,\n",
      "When all was wild expanse of sea and air,\n",
      "Then doom’d high Jove due vengeance to prepare.\n",
      "He hung a night of horrors o’er their head\n",
      "(The shaded ocean blacken’d as it spread):\n",
      "He launch’d the fiery bolt: from pole to pole\n",
      "Broad burst the lightnings, deep the thunders roll;\n",
      "In giddy rounds the whirling ship is toss’d,\n",
      "And all in clouds of smothering sulphur lost.\n",
      "As from a hanging rock’s tremendous height,\n",
      "The sable crows with intercepted flight\n",
      "Drop endlong; scarr’d, and black with sulphurous hue,\n",
      "So from the deck are hurl’d the ghastly crew.\n",
      "Such end the wicked found! but Jove’s intent\n",
      "Was yet to save the oppress’d and innocent.\n",
      "Placed on the mast (the last resource of life)\n",
      "With winds and waves I held unequal strife:\n",

      "The monarch’s son a shipwreck’d wretch relieved,\n",

      "With gifts of price and gorgeous garments graced\n",
      "While here I sojourn’d, oft I heard the fame\n",
      "How late Ulysses to the country came.\n",
      "How loved, how honour’d in this court he stay’d,\n",
      "And here his whole collected treasure laid;\n",
      "I saw myself the vast unnumber’d store\n",
      "Of steel elaborate, and refulgent ore,\n",
      "And brass high heap’d amidst the regal dome;\n",
      "Immense supplies for ages yet to come!\n",
      "Meantime he voyaged to explore the will\n",
      "Of Jove, on high Dodona’s holy hill,\n",
      "What means might best his safe return avail,\n",
      "To come in pomp, or bear a secret sail?\n",
      "Full oft has Phidon, whilst he pour’d the wine,\n",
      "Attesting solemn all the powers divine,\n",
      "That soon Ulysses would return, declared\n",
      "The sailors waiting, and the ships prepared.\n",
      "But first the king dismiss’d me from his shores,\n",
      "For fair Dulichium crown’d with fruitful stores;\n",
      "To good Acastus’ friendly care consign’d:\n",
      "But other counsels pleased the sailors’ mind:\n",
      "New frauds were plotted by the faithless train,\n",
      "And misery demands me once again.\n",
      "Soon as remote from shore they plough the wave,\n",
      "With ready hands they rush to seize their slave;\n",
      "Then with these tatter’d rags they wrapp’d me round\n",
