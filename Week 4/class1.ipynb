The light for ever is morning light;\\n    The hills are verdured pasture-wise;\\n    The angel hosts with freshness go,\\n    And seek with laughter what to brave;--\\n    And binding all is the

'One thought in agony of strife\\n    The bravest would have by for friend,\\n    The memory that he chose the life;\\n    But the pure fate to which you go\\n    Admits no memory of choice,\\n    Or the woe were not earthly woe\\n    To which you give the assenting voice.'\\n    And so the choice must be again,\\n    But the last choice is still the same;\\n    And the awe passes wonder then,\\n    And a hush falls for all acclaim.\\n    And God has taken a flower of gold\\n    And broken it, and used therefrom\\n    The mystic link to bind and hold\\n    Spirit to matter till death come.\\n    'Tis of the essence of life here,\\n    Though we choose greatly, still to lack\\n    The lasting memory at all clear,\\n    That life has for us on the wrack\\n    Nothing but what we somehow chose;\\n    Thus are we wholly stripped of pride\\n    In the pain that has but one close,\\n    Bearing it crushed and mystified.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn Equal Sacrifice\\n\\n    THUS of old the Douglas did:\\n    He left his land as he was bid\\n    With the royal heart of Robert the Bruce\\n    In a golden case with a golden lid,\\n    To carry the same to the Holy Land;\\n    By which we see and understand\\n    That that was the place to carry a heart\\n    At loyalty and love's command,\\n    And that was the case to carry it in.\\n    The Douglas had not far to win\\n    Before he came to the land of Spain,\\n    Where long a holy war had been\\n    Against the too-victorious Moor;\\n    And there his courage could not endure\\n    Not to strike a blow for God\\n    Before he made his errand sure.\\n    And ever it was intended so,\\n    That a man for God should strike a blow,\\n    No matter the heart he has in charge\\n    For the Holy Land where hearts should go.\\n    But when in battle the foe were met,\\n    The Douglas found him sore beset,\\n    With only strength of the fighting arm\\n    For one more battle passage yet--\\n    And that as vain to save the day\\n    As bring his body safe away--\\n    Only a signal deed to do\\n    And a last sounding word to say.\\n    The heart he wore in a golden chain\\n    He swung and flung forth into the plain,\\n    And followed it crying 'Heart or death!'\\n    And fighting over it perished fain.\\n    So may another do of right,\\n    Give a heart to the hopeless fight,\\n    The more of right the more he loves;\\n    So may another redouble might\\n    For a few swift gleams of the angry brand,\\n    Scorning greatly not to demand\\n    In equal sacrifice with his\\n    The heart he bore to the Holy Land.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Tuft of Flowers\\n\\n    I WENT to turn the grass once after one\\n    Who mowed it in the dew before the sun.\\n    The dew was gone that made his blade so keen\\n    Before I came to view the leveled scene.\\n    I looked for him behind an isle of trees;\\n    I listened for his whetstone on the breeze.\\n    But he had gone his way, the grass all mown,\\n    And I must be, as he had been,--alone,\\n    'As all must be,' I said within my heart,\\n    'Whether they work together or apart.'\\n    But as I said it, swift there passed me by\\n    On noiseless wing a 'wildered butterfly,\\n    Seeking with memories grown dim o'er night\\n    Some resting flower of yesterday's delight.\\n    And once I marked his flight go round and round,\\n    As where some flower lay withering on the ground.\\n    And then he flew as far as eye could see,\\n    And then on tremulous wing came back to me.\\n    I thought of questions that have no reply,\\n    And would have turned to toss the grass to dry;\\n    But he turned first, and led my eye to look\\n    At a tall tuft of flowers beside a brook,\\n    A leaping tongue of bloom the scythe had spared\\n    Beside a reedy brook the scythe had bared.\\n    I left my place to know them by their name,\\n    Finding them butterfly weed when I came.\\n    The mower in the dew had loved them thus,\\n    By leaving them to flourish, not for us,\\n    Nor yet to draw one thought of ours to him.\\n    But from sheer morning gladness at the brim.\\n    The butterfly and I had lit upon,\\n    Nevertheless, a message from the dawn,\\n    That made me hear the wakening birds around,\\n    And hear his long scythe whispering to the ground,\\n    And feel a spirit kindred to my own;\\n    So that henceforth I worked no more alone;\\n    But glad with him, I worked as with his aid,\\n    And weary, sought at noon with him the shade;\\n    And dreaming, as it were, held brotherly speech\\n    With one whose thought I had not hoped to reach.\\n    'Men work together,' I told him from the heart,\\n    'Whether they work together or apart.'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpoils of the Dead\\n\\n    TWO fairies it was\\n

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\\n\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\\n\\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\n\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\n\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n\""
